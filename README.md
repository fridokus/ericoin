Test implementation of a p2p PoW cryptocurrency in python

## How to run
Start by running ``generate_keys.py``. This will create a private and public key.

``setup_2_miners_1_bookkeeper.py`` can be run in Windows as a quickstart, otherwise you'll have to figure out some stuff.. look at that script to figure out what to do.

## Register remote nodes
To add remote nodes to your network, use the script ``register_nodes.py``. To add nodes outside your LAN they will have to open ports.
