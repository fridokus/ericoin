Test implementation of a p2p PoW cryptocurrency in python

## How to run
Start by running ``generate_keys.py``. This will create a private and public key.

``setup_2_miners_1_bookkeeper.py`` can be run in Windows as a quickstart, otherwise you'll have to figure out some stuff.. look at that script to figure out what to do.
